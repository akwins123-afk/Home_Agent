🏠 Self-Developing Home Agent
An intelligent smart home automation system that optimizes energy usage while maintaining user comfort using context-aware AI decisions.

🚀 Overview
The Self-Developing Home Agent controls home devices like Air Conditioner and Fan based on:
Room temperature
Target temperature
Energy consumption
Occupancy
The system evaluates its own actions, measures regret, and provides self-critical feedback to encourage energy-efficient behavior.

✨ Key Features
🧠 AI-assisted decision making (AC / Fan / AC+Fan)
🔄 Regret detection for inefficient user choices
⚡ Energy-aware optimization logic
📬 Smart inbox with contextual alerts
📊 Plotly graphs for temperature & energy trends
👤 Human-in-the-loop control (user approval for AI actions)

🛠 Tech Stack
Python
Streamlit
Plotly
Rule-based AI with regret evaluation

🤖 Model Training?
No heavy ML model is trained.
The project uses a hybrid rule-based intelligent agent with learning via memory, feedback, and regret analysis, making it ML-ready for future extensions.

🎯 Objective
Demonstrate how self-critical intelligent agents can improve energy efficiency, explain decisions, and adapt behavior over time.
